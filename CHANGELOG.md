## Path IO 1.2.0

* Added `walkDir` function to traverse a directory tree with a handler.

* Added `walkDirAccum` function which is like `walkDir` but also accumulates
  the output of the handler and returns it.

* Added `listDirRecurWith` function which is like `listDirRecur` but with
  predicates to select directories and files.

* Added `listDirRecurWithPruned` function which is like `listDirRecurWith` but
  does not traverse the selected directories further.

## Path IO 1.1.0

* Fixed bug in `copyDirRecur` when it was unable to fully copy read-only
  directories.

* Added `copyDirRecur'` function that works just like `copyDirRecur`, but
  does not preserve directory permissions.

## Path IO 1.0.1

* Fixed bug in `copyDirRecur` for non-existing destination paths when
  directory to copy does not contain sub-directories.

* Made `copyDirRecur` try to copy permissions for destination directory too
  (previously it only tried to copy them for sub-directories).

## Path IO 1.0.0

* Changed signature of `getAppUserDataDir`, so it takes `String` as the
  first argument.

* Removed deprecated `forgivingAbsence'` function.

* Made `findFile` lazier, it stops searching as soon as a file is found.

* Added some tests.

## Path IO 0.3.1

* Introduced synonym for `forgivingAbsence'` â€”
  `ignoringAbsence`. `forgivingAbsence'` is deprecated now, but it's still
  there.

* Added a handy shortcut `ensureDir` that is defined as
  `ensureDir = createDirIfMissing True`.

* Made `getHomeDir` and `getTempDir` more robust when they are influenced by
  values of environment variables.

## Path IO 0.3.0

* Added `forgivingAbsence`, `resolveFile`, and `resolveDir` functions, so
  the package now provides all functionality that `Path.IO` module in Stack
  has.

* Added closed type family `RelPath`, `makeRelative`, and
  `makeRelativeToCurrentDir` functions.

* Fixed signature of `getAppUserDataDir`.

## Path IO 0.2.0

* Added functions from `temporary`: `withTempFile`, `withTempDir`,
  `withSystemTempFile`, `withSystemTempDir`, `openTempFile`,
  `openBinaryTempFile`, and `createTempDir`. `temporary` is a lightweight
  and ubiquitous package, so depending on it should be OK.

## Path IO 0.1.1

* Fixed type signatures of `renameFile` and `copyFile`.

## Path IO 0.1.0

* Initial release.
