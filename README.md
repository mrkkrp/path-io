This package provides interface to
[`directory`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/directory) package for
users of Chris Done's [`path`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path). It
also implements some missing stuff like recursive scanning and copying of
directories.

Consult Haddocks for usage, which should be trivial.
