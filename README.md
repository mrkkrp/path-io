This package provides an interface to
the [`directory`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/directory) package for
users of Chris Done's [`path`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/path). It
also implements some missing stuff like recursive scanning and copying of
directories, working with temporary files/directories, etc.

Consult Haddocks for usage, which should be trivial.
